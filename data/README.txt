** Data sets **

cho.txt and iyer.txt are the two datasets to be used in Project 2. 
We will upload two more datasets for the demo on Nov. 13.

** Data set format **
*********************

Each row represents a gene:
1) the first column is gene_id.
2) the second column is the ground truth clusters. The ground truths should only be used for evaluation (i.e., compute external index). "-1" means outliers.
3) the remaining columns represent gene's expression values (attribute).
